## Description

Forest fires pose a significant threat to the conservation of Tropical Forests. Analyzing the occurrence of forest fires over time is crucial for implementing measures to mitigate their impact. The Amazon rainforest, situated in Brazil, stands as the largest rainforest globally, underlining the importance of addressing and preventing these fires in this vital ecosystem.

In this exploratory data analysis, I'll explore the forest fires in Brazil and focus on understanding how often they happen each year, each month, and in different states. I want to see where they happen and if there are any patterns or changes over time. Additionally, I plan to visualize the findings through various graphs to enhance the clarity and interpretability of the obtained insights.

## Dataset Overview
The information has been sourced from the official website of the Brazilian government.
Datset : http://dados.gov.br/dataset/sistema-nacional-de-informacoes-florestais-snif
1) Time Period: The data spans from the year 1998 to 2017.
2) States: There are 23 unique states in the dataset.
3) Months: The data covers all 12 months of the year. 
4) Number of Fires: The 'number' column represents the count of forest fires. 
5) Date: The date column indicates that the forest fire data is recorded on specific dates. 

## __Motivation__

This dataset provides an opportunity to analyze the progression of forest fires over the years and identify the specific regions where they were prevalent. The defined region of interest, the legal Amazon, encompasses states such as Acre, Amapá, Pará, Amazonas, Rondonia, Roraima, and portions of Mato Grosso, Tocantins, and Maranhão. This information can contribute to a better understanding of the patterns and trends associated with forest fires in these areas.

## Observations: 
The maximum number of fires were reported in July.
In 2003 the maximum number of fires were reported.
Mato Grosso has the highest number of fires among all states, followed by Paraíba and São Paulo.
1.Given Dataset has 6454 rows and 5 columns and in this dataset we have 2 types of datatype which is in numerical and object. 2.In this data set we have zero null values. 3.Memory usage in this dataset is 252.2+ K 4.We had 32 duplicates values in this dataset 5.Total number of fire registered is 6454. 6.After analysing the data we can say that the maximum number of cases were registered in july. 7.In year 2003 the maximum number of forest fire cases were being registered. 8.After analysing the data we can say that the state of Mato Grosso has the maximum number of fire cases. 9.In Amazonas state total number of forest fire were being reported is 30650 and in year 2002 there was 2852 fire cases were reported which was the maximum number of cases being reported which is maximum number by any year. 10.After analysing the data we can say that the highest average of forest fire cases were being registered in the state of Sao Paulo which is 213 And lowest average of forest fire cases were being registered in the state of Sergipe which is 13.
